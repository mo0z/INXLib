This is a very simple code of what could be a simple game in which the player
tries to follow the bounces of a sphere in a box as the sphere accelerates.
It is meant to demonstrate how the INXLib X11/OpenGL skeleton can be used as
a framework for building 3D applications. This was built on top of v0.1.

The OpenGL part of the programming is done in a very crude manner, not caring
at all for efficiency, so that anyone studying the code can more easily follow
the logic and details.

Questions and comments are welcome. Modification and re-ddistribution of the
code, if found useful, is permitted provided all terms of licensing are met.

Happy hacking!
